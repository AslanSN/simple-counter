# Counter exercise
## Intro
Exercise in which we had to do a simple counter based on this one showed just bellow, with **React**:

But I decided due to some preferences (count the real time as a stopwatch) I did it adding the type of data shown. And in order to invest optimal time and not mess with appearances, I simply wanted it to be visual and properly grouped. 

Here is the result of the preview as a photo:
